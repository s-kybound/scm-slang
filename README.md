# scm-slang

## scm-slang?

`scm-slang` is an **experimental** implementation of the [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/) programming language designed for compatibiity with the online learning environment of [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org/). It aims to be faithful to the original *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (SICP) book whilst maintaining compatibility with modules designed for use with [`js-slang`](https://github.com/source-academy/js-slang), a subset of JavaScript intended for use with the SICP JS book in Source Academy.

`scm-slang` provides a special Scheme parser that is able to parse Scheme code. It also supports standard Scheme data structures such as Lists, Vectors and the Numeric tower.

## How does it work?

`scm-slang` parses a subset of Scheme (minimally, enough to fulfil SICP chapters 1-4) and generates an `estree`-compatible AST. This way, `scm-slang` allows code written in SCM Source Languages to use modules written for JS Source Languages.

## Comparison with Revised‚Å∑ Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme

`scm-slang` ultimately follows the [R7RS language specification](https://small.r7rs.org/) of Scheme. However, there are several key deviations that differentiate `scm-slang` from a complete implementation of R7RS Scheme:

- Continuations: The parser itself does not support continuations, but in conjunction with the Source Academy Explicit Control Evaluator, continuations are supported within the Source Academy ecosystem.

- Macros: Not implemented at the moment. Set for completion in Autumn-Fall 2024.

- Types: `scm-slang` does not support characters or bytevectors at the moment.

- Parentheses: `scm-slang` supports the use of square brackets (i.e. []) interchangably with parentheses in order to enhance the visual representation of Scheme code, similar to [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) or [Guile Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/). [See relevant discussion here](http://community.schemewiki.org/?scheme-faq-language)

- Named let is not supported.

- Import/Export: `scm-slang` follows a specialised import/export system that deviates from any standard Scheme implementation. It follows more closely to JavaScript syntax so as to maintain compatibility with current Source Academy modules.

```scheme
;equivalent JavaScript to import:
;import { stack, beside } from "runes";
(import "runes" (stack beside))
```

```scheme
;equivalent JavaScript to export:
;export let foo = "bar";
(export (define foo "bar"))
```
